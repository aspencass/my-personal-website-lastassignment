        Cassidy is a Colorado native with a background as a dance artist. 
        She danced professionally across Europe and the Middle East after receiving a degree
        in Dance from New York University. Since 2019 she's immeresed herself in studying 
        the 
        <a href="https://www.gagapeople.com/en">Gaga Movement Language</a>
         with Ohad Naharin, which involved living in Tel Aviv 
        pre-pandemic. She now teaches a weekly Sunday Gaga class in Denver and produces 
        collaborative contemporary dance performances in local galleries downtown as 
        part of the Santa Fe Art District's First Friday Art Walks. These evenings explore 
        movement improvisation exercises and consciously delegate creative freedom 
        to the performers and dancers involved. Simple pleasures include driving with the 
        windows down, coffee, plants, breakfast burritos, dancing, and now coding!
